# beats_externship
This repository contains the project work to gain insight into costumer reviews on Beats products and its competitors. This project was completed as part of the Beats by Dre Consumer Insights Data Analytics Externship, facilitated by Extern. The primary objective was to analyze consumer reviews using sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive strategic insights for brand development.

## Key Contributions
ðŸ”¹ Programming & Data Science
    Developed Python-based data analysis pipelines leveraging pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
	Employed NLP techniques to process and analyze consumer feedback efficiently.
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and text normalization.
	Used matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly to create visualizations that revealed key patterns in the data.
ðŸ”¹ Sentiment Analysis & Consumer Insights
	Implemented sentiment classification using tools like VADER, TextBlob, and Gemini AI to gauge consumer sentiment.
	Analyzed review polarity and subjectivity to understand customer satisfaction trends.
ðŸ”¹ Strategic Insight Development
	Summarized consumer sentiment data into actionable insights for brand strategy.
	Designed data visualizations and reports to communicate findings effectively.
